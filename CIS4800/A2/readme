Assignment #2
--------------------------

Compiling
---------
To compile, use the 'make' command. It will build the executable with g++.
It is expected that this is being compiled in an environment which is setup equivalently to the Mac labs.

Running the Program
-------------------
Once the assignment is compiled, type 'a2'.

The program should start, and will present a 3d scene of a grey frame with a red ball inside of it. The light is coming from a top-right direction.

The ball should begin moving and bouncing around as the program runs. It will auto-correct any repeated bounce-cycles after 3 hits to make the bouncing more interesting. 

There is also a secondary window which presents sliders of customizable lighting settings, and allows you to tweak the red/green/blue values of the ambient, diffuse and specular lights of the light source.

This window will let you customize the angle of the ball, also. It expects angles in integer degrees between 0..360, or a -1 to indicate that a random angle should be used (the default).

To exit the program, click the Exit button in the secondary window. (GLUT or GLUI seem to disable default close on a Mac, which is strange, but this oddity is also present in the samples.)

Acknowledgements
----------------

I referenced source from the sample code package in order to learn how to use how GL/GLUT/GLUI worked. Some elements are referenced from there. 

However, for the most part, I've written a fresh C++ namespace with classes to handle all the different aspects, such as colors, lights, 2D/3D/4D vector types, collision detection, reflection angles, and renderable primitives.

Anyways. That should be all you need to to use and understand how my program works, I think.

Good luck!
