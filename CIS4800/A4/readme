Assignment #4
--------------------------

Compiling
---------
To compile, use the 'make' command. It will build the executable with g++.
It is expected that this is being compiled in an environment which is setup equivalently to the Mac labs.

Running the Program
-------------------
Once the assignment is compiled, type 'a4'.

The program should start, and in a primary window will present a 3d scene with a heightmap. 

There is also a secondary window which presents sliders for the red/green/blue values of the heightmap's material color, a checkbox to randomize, and file input field to switch to a heightmap of your own.

Use W and A to rotate the object.

To exit the program, click the Exit button in the secondary window. (GLUT or GLUI seem to disable default close on a Mac, which is strange, but this oddity is also present in the samples.)


Useful Contents
---------------
greyTextures/       folder containing sample PGM files
a4.cpp              The main file which glues GLUI library calls and heightmap code together
a4.h                A common header which includes everything.
heightmap.cpp       
heightmap.h         The heightmap object.
vector*.h           Vector objects representing tuples of real numbers. I think Vector3 is the most fleshed out.
light.h             The lighting object, responsible for GL light settings.
color.h             The color object, capable of splitting an unsigned integer into an equivalent float array of color channel values
transformation.h    The transformation object, capable of applying translation, scaling, and independent x, y, and z rotations to a scene.
makefile            The file used to build this assignment


Anyways. That should be all you need to to use and understand how my program works, I think.

Good luck!
