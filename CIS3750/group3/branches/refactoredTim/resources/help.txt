<h1><b>The Incredible Machine!</b></h1>

<h2><b>Overview</b></h2>

This is a re-make of The Incredible Machine.  It comes with a free-play mode and a puzzle mode.  In free-play mode, any pieces can be placed on the screen (and have infinite quantity).  Each created level can be saved and loaded.  The "world" used in the game can be altered via air pressure and gravity.

In terms of puzzle-mode, a semi-complete machine is loaded, and it's up to you to pick the appropriate parts to complete the puzzle.  Be careful though!  The longer it takes you to complete the machine, the lower your score!
