University of Guelph - School Work and Stuff
============================================
**by Andrew G. Crowell**

Various undergraduate school work during 2006 - 2010, the span of my Honours Bachelor of Computing and Information Science degree program at the [University of Guelph](http://uoguelph.ca/). There were some neat projects in my time there, and I thought it'd be nice to have an online backup of my work. I make no guarantees about the quality, completeness, sanity, or suitability of any of these projects. This repo does not include every single course (let alone CS course) that I took at university, but all of the source that I can find will be added here, for record-keeping and fun.

I do not endorse academic misconduct, but otherwise I don't really care what you use this code for. The MIT license simply requires *attribution* -- making it unsuitable for most school work (because they usually require independent work), but otherwise fine and dandy. Just give credit where it is due (to obey copyright law invoked by this license), and actually do your own work for assignments where you're required to do so (academic policies). Stealing code is lame, okay?

This is simply an personal archive of my school work, but perhaps you may also find it interesting. That is all.
